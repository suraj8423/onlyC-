        {
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            string message = $"Credit Card Number: {creditCard.CardNumber} Name: {creditCard.Name} Processed";
            return message;
        }
    }

    public class CreditCard
    {
        public string CardNumber { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public static List<CreditCard> GenerateCreditCards(int number)
        {
            List<CreditCard> creditCards = new List<CreditCard>();
            for (int i = 0; i < number; i++)
            {
                CreditCard card = new CreditCard()
                {
                    CardNumber = "10000000" + i,
                    Name = "CreditCard-" + i
                };

                creditCards.Add(card);
            }

            return creditCards;
        }
    }
}

```
- Here we are processing 100000 cards simultaneously that is not good thing right, let say you have send 100000 HTTP request to your server,the server might be unable to handle such a huge request, or if we send 100000 HTTP requests to a server, it might be blocked or down.

## Does it wait for all 3 tasks to finish before letting others in?
- No, it does not wait for all 3 to complete.
- SemaphoreSlim works on a first-come, first-served basis.

- As soon as any one of the running tasks releases the semaphore (i.e., calls semaphoreSlim.Release()), one waiting task is allowed in.

- we have this line await semaphoreSlim.WaitAsync();

* That means:

- "If thereâ€™s a slot available, proceed."

- "If not, wait until someone releases a slot."

* Letâ€™s assume the following:

- Cards 1, 2, 3 start first and each takes 1 second to process.

- Card 1 finishes in 1 second.

- As soon as Card 1 calls semaphoreSlim.Release() in its finally block...

- The next waiting card (Card 4) is immediately allowed to start.

- Cards 2 and 3 may still be processing â€” and thatâ€™s totally fine.

- ðŸ”¢ At most, 3 tasks will be running concurrently at any point.


## How to Handle Response when Executing Multiple Tasks using Tasks.WhenAll Method in C#?

- if we will hover on the await Task.WhenAll(tasks) we can see it is showing string[].
- And our method ProcessCard is also returning Task<string> so if you want to read all the results code will be

```csharp
string[] Responses= await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

```
