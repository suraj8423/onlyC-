# Why Multiple Inheritance is Not Supported Through Classes in C#

## Ambiguity Problem

Multiple inheritance is not supported in C# through classes because it introduces the **ambiguity problem**.

### What is the Ambiguity Problem?

In C#, a class cannot have two methods with the same name and the same parameters (i.e., the same signature). If it were allowed, the compiler would get confused when a method is invoked, as it wouldn't know which method to execute.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine a class `Class3` that inherits from two base classes: `Class1` and `Class2`.

```csharp
public class Class1
{
    public void Test() { Console.WriteLine("Class1 Test"); }
}

public class Class2
{
    public void Test() { Console.WriteLine("Class2 Test"); }
}

// Invalid in C#
public class Class3 : Class1, Class2
{
}
```

Here, both `Class1` and `Class2` define a method called `Test()`. If `Class3` tries to inherit from both, it would inherit **two** methods with the same signature. This results in ambiguity, because when `Class3.Test()` is called, the compiler does not know whether to use the version from `Class1` or `Class2`.

#### Error

The compiler throws an error:
> The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: ‘Class3.Test()’ and ‘Class3.Test()’

### Why Interfaces Don't Have This Problem

Interfaces **do not** create ambiguity because they **do not provide implementations**—they only define method signatures. When a class implements multiple interfaces with the same method, the class is **required** to provide its own implementation of that method.

So, interfaces offer **contracts** to be implemented, not methods to be consumed. Hence, there's no ambiguity.

#### Interface Example

```csharp
public interface I1
{
    void Test();
}

public interface I2
{
    void Test();
}

public class MyClass : I1, I2
{
    public void Test()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Implementation of Test");
    }
}
```

In the above example, although both interfaces define a method named `Test()`, the ambiguity doesn't arise because `MyClass` must implement the method itself.

## Conclusion

- **Multiple inheritance through classes** is not allowed in C# to avoid ambiguity.
- **Multiple inheritance through interfaces** is allowed because implementation is handled by the class, not inherited from the interfaces.



# Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces in C#

## Understanding Multiple Inheritance in C#

C# does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but it **does** support multiple inheritance using **interfaces**.

## Example

### Step 1: Define Two Interfaces

```csharp
public interface Interface1
{
    void Test();
}

public interface Interface2
{
    void Test();
}
```

- Both interfaces define the same method: `Test()`.

### Step 2: Create a Class that Implements Both Interfaces

```csharp
public class MultipleInheritanceTest : Interface1, Interface2
{
}
```

- If you try to compile this, you will get two compile-time errors:
  - `Interface1.Test()` not implemented.
  - `Interface2.Test()` not implemented.

### Step 3: Implement the Test Method

```csharp
public class MultipleInheritanceTest : Interface1, Interface2
{
    public void Test()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Test Method is Implemented in Child Class");
    }
}
```

- Once you implement the `Test()` method **once**, both errors are resolved.

## Why Does This Work?

- **Interfaces demand implementation**, not consumption.
- The `Test()` method in the class satisfies **both** interfaces.
- `Interface1` does **not** know about `Interface2`, and vice versa.
- When the class provides a `Test()` method:
  - `Interface1` sees it and is satisfied.
  - `Interface2` also sees it and is satisfied.

## Key Points

- One implementation of `Test()` satisfies both `Interface1` and `Interface2`.
- There is **no ambiguity** because:
  - Both interfaces are **unaware** of each other.
  - They independently validate that their `Test()` method has been implemented.

## Analogy

> We are "cheating" both interfaces by giving them the **same** method, and since they are unaware of each other, they both assume the method is theirs.

## Summary

- C# allows multiple inheritance through interfaces.
- If two interfaces have methods with the **same name and signature**, implementing the method **once** in the derived class is sufficient.
- There is **no conflict or ambiguity** as long as the method signatures match.


```csharp
using System;
namespace MultipleInheritance
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MultipleInheritanceTest obj = new MultipleInheritanceTest();
            obj.Test();
            //You cannot call the Show method using obj
            //obj.Show();

            //Using Interface Reference call the Show method
            Interface1 i1 = obj;
            i1.Show();

            //Typecase the object to interface type and call the show method
            ((Interface2)obj).Show();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public interface Interface1
    {
        void Test();
        void Show();
    }
    public interface Interface2
    {
        void Test();
        void Show();
    }

    public class MultipleInheritanceTest : Interface1, Interface2
    {
        //Normal Implementation
        public void Test()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Test Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }

        //Explicit Interface Implementation
        void Interface1.Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Interface1 Show Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }

        //Explicit Interface Implementation
        void Interface2.Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Interface2 Show Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }
    }
}
```
