# Abstraction in C#

## What is Abstraction?

**Abstraction** is the process of representing the essential features of an object without including the background or implementation details. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

In simple terms:
> *Abstraction is the process of defining a class by exposing necessary details (what the class does) while hiding the internal implementation (how it does it).*

This allows users of the class to interact with objects and call their methods without knowing how those methods are implemented internally.

## Why Use Abstraction?

- **To hide complexity:** End users or other developers don’t need to worry about internal logic.
- **To increase security:** Only relevant information is exposed.
- **To focus on the functionality:** The emphasis is on "what to do" rather than "how to do it".

## Real-Time Analogy

Think of a **TV remote**:
- You press the power button to turn the TV on/off (You know *what* it does).
- But you don’t know *how* internally it works or transmits infrared signals (That is abstracted away).

## Programmatic Definition

In code, **abstraction** means hiding implementation details and only showing essential methods or properties necessary to the outside world.

This can be achieved in C# by using:

- **Abstract classes**
- **Interfaces**

These let you define a contract for classes, which must implement the necessary methods but hide how they are implemented.
