# Middleware 

## ðŸš¦ 1. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?

- ðŸ‘‰ Middleware is a piece of code that sits in the HTTP request pipeline and processes incoming requests and outgoing responses.

- Each middleware:

- Receives the HTTP request

- Does something (e.g., logging, authentication, routing)

- Then either:

- Passes the request to the next middleware in the pipeline, or

- Short-circuits the pipeline and sends the response immediately

## ðŸ”„ 2. The Request Pipeline Concept

- Imagine the ASP.NET Core app like this pipeline ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
Incoming Request â†’
   [Middleware 1] â†’ [Middleware 2] â†’ [Middleware 3] â†’ Endpoint (Controller)
                                  â†‘
                             Response travels back

```

- Each middleware can:

- Modify the Request

- Modify the Response

- Decide whether to pass to next middleware or not
