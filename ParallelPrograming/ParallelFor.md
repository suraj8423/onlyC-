# Parallel For Loop in C#

## What is Parallel For Loop?

In C#, the `Parallel.For` loop is part of the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** and is designed to parallelize `for` loops by executing iterations concurrently across multiple threads. It is especially useful for **CPU-bound operations**, enabling better use of multi-core processors to improve performance.

---

## Key Characteristics

- Executes multiple iterations in parallel.
- Utilizes multiple threads (managed by the TPL).
- Efficient for expensive operations where each iteration is **independent**.
- Does **not guarantee sequential order** of execution.

## Differences: `Parallel.For` vs Standard `for` Loop

| Feature                        | Standard `for` Loop        | `Parallel.For` Loop             |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Threads Used                  | Single thread              | Multiple threads                |
| Execution Order               | Sequential                 | Non-sequential                  |
| Performance (CPU-bound tasks) | Slower                     | Faster (for expensive operations) |
| Thread Safety Required?       | Rarely                    | Yes, if sharing state           |

**Note:**  
Use `Parallel.For` **only when**:
- Each iteration is independent of the others.
- The operation inside the loop is time-consuming enough to offset parallelism overhead.

## Example: Comparing Standard vs Parallel For Loop

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ParallelProgrammingDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("C# For Loop");
            int number = 10;

            for (int count = 0; count < number; count++)
            {
                // Outputs thread ID to show single-threaded execution
                Console.WriteLine($"value of count = {count}, thread = {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
                Thread.Sleep(10); // Simulates workload
            }

            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("Parallel For Loop");
            Parallel.For(0, number, count =>
            {
                // Outputs thread ID to show multi-threaded execution
                Console.WriteLine($"value of count = {count}, thread = {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
                Thread.Sleep(10); // Simulates workload
            });

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Output Illustration (Sample)

```
C# For Loop
value of count = 0, thread = 1
value of count = 1, thread = 1
...
value of count = 9, thread = 1

Parallel For Loop
value of count = 3, thread = 5
value of count = 1, thread = 4
value of count = 0, thread = 3
...
value of count = 9, thread = 6
```

Note how the `Parallel.For` loop distributes iterations across different thread IDs, indicating parallel execution.

---

## When Not to Use `Parallel.For`

- When loop iterations depend on each other.
- When operations are lightweight (low computation cost).
- When performance testing shows no significant improvement or degradation.
- When thread safety is hard to maintain (due to shared resources).

---

## Summary

- `Parallel.For` is a powerful tool for executing loop iterations in parallel.
- It’s ideal for compute-heavy, independent operations.
- Always benchmark to confirm actual performance gains.


# Difference Between `for` and `foreach` in C#

| Feature                    | `for`                          | `foreach`                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Syntax                    | Manual index-based loop         | Enumerator-based loop            |
| Index Access              | ✅ Yes                          | ❌ No                            |
| Read/Write Access         | ✅ Read & Write                 | ✅ Read-only                     |
| Supported Collections     | Arrays, Lists (indexables)      | Any `IEnumerable`                |
| Modifying Collection      | ✅ Possible (with care)         | ❌ Throws exception              |
| Flexibility (e.g., skip)  | ✅ High                         | ❌ Limited                       |
| Readability               | ❌ Verbose                      | ✅ Cleaner and simpler           |
| Performance               | ✅ Slightly faster (arrays)     | ❌ Slightly slower               |

### When to Use
- Use `for` when you need index, control over iteration, or plan to modify the collection.
- Use `foreach` for simple read-only iteration over collections.
