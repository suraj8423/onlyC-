# What is Parallel Programming in C#?

Parallel programming in C# is the process of executing multiple computations concurrently to **improve performance and responsiveness**. It is a form of **concurrency** where tasks run simultaneously on multiple processors or cores.

---

## Concept Overview

In a parallel model:
- The same task can be divided into **multiple processes**.
- Each process can be executed across **multiple cores**.
- Each core can run **multiple threads**, concurrently executing application code.

Parallelism is primarily achieved in C# using the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**.

## Basics of Parallel Programming

### 1. Data Parallelism
- Involves performing the **same operation** on elements of a collection concurrently.
- Example: Filtering or transforming elements of an array in parallel.

### 2. Task Parallelism
- Involves executing **multiple distinct tasks** concurrently.
- Each task may perform a different operation.
- Example: Sending an email and an SMS in parallel.

## Core Classes and Namespaces

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `System.Threading.Tasks` | Namespace containing TPL types like `Task` and `Parallel`. |
| `Parallel` | Static class with methods like `Parallel.For` and `Parallel.ForEach`. |
| `PLINQ` | Parallel version of LINQ for working with collections concurrently. |

## Advantages of Parallel Programming

- **Performance**: Efficient use of CPU cores reduces total execution time.
- **Responsiveness**: Keeps UI applications responsive by offloading heavy work to background threads.

---

## Considerations When Using Parallel Programming

- **Overhead**: Splitting and combining tasks has overhead. Use only for compute-heavy tasks.
- **Ordering**: Result order may not be preserved. Order preservation can reduce performance.
- **Synchronization**: Shared resources require locking or use of thread-safe collections.
- **Max Degree of Parallelism**: You can control the number of concurrent tasks (e.g., via `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` in PLINQ).

## Parallel vs Asynchronous Programming

| Aspect              | Parallel Programming             | Asynchronous Programming          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Focus               | Performance via multiple cores   | Responsiveness without blocking   |
| Execution           | Simultaneous on multiple threads | Non-blocking on a single thread   |
| Use Case            | CPU-bound tasks                  | I/O-bound or long-running tasks   |

---

## Summary

- Parallel programming boosts performance by running multiple tasks at once.
- C# enables this through TPL, `Parallel` class, and PLINQ.
- Choose parallelism for **CPU-bound**, **independent**, and **costly** tasks.
- Always assess performance trade-offs and synchronization needs.
